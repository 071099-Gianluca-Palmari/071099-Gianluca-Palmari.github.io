Research interests
======
  Machine learning and Time series
  ------
  I am interested in dynamical systems and their applications to time series analysis and machine learning. Specifically, I focus on developing prediction and filtering methods using this framework. With the increasing volume of data and the need for real-time decision-making, online methods have become increasingly important in recent years. My goal is to bridge the gap between practical requirements and the scientific understanding we have of these methods.

  Market Microstructure 
  ------ 
  For the past three years, I have been focused on studying price formation and price impact models. This research is driven by two key objectives: gaining a deeper understanding of the microstructural properties of financial markets and the price formation mechanism, and developing new models and techniques for optimal execution. Both of these aspects lie at the heart of modern quantitative finance and financial mathematics, addressing critical questions for both the academic community and practitioners alike.
  
About me
======
PhD student specializing in Mathematical Models and Computational Methods for Science and Finance. My research focuses on machine learning, time series analysis, and probability theory, with an emphasis on their applications in quantitative finance, particularly in market microstructure.

For the past three years, I have been conducting research as part of my PhD at Scuola Normale Superiore, under the supervision of Prof. F. Lillo (SNS-University of Bologna) and Prof. G. Livieri (LSE). My work centers on developing online methods in machine learning and applying them to financial markets. I also collaborate with Dr. Z. Eisler (Senior Financial Analyst at Cubist) on price impact and optimal execution problems. Our first paper, *Optimal execution with deterministically time varying liquidity: well posedness and price manipulation*, is available online at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04867).
